Slide 1 – Title

“Good morning everyone.
We are Team Nirmaan.
Our problem statement is Blockchain-based Supply Chain Transparency for Agricultural Produce under the theme Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development.”

🎤 Slide 2 – Idea Title

“Our solution is a Blockchain-based digital platform to track and trace farm produce.
Every stage like harvest, storage, transport, and retail is recorded securely.
This increases trust between farmers, distributors, retailers, and consumers.
It also reduces fraud and middleman exploitation.
Our unique features are:

Smart contracts for automatic farmer payments.

QR codes for consumers to verify products.”

🎤 Slide 3 – Technical Approach

“We plan to use:

Ethereum Blockchain and Web3,

Smart contracts with ERC-20 tokens,

React.js and Tailwind CSS for frontend,

Node.js and Express.js for backend,

MongoDB for database.

The process works like this:
Farmers upload crop details and get a batch ID.
Each transaction is logged on blockchain.
Smart contracts release payments automatically.
Consumers scan a QR code to see the full product journey.”

🎤 Slide 4 – Feasibility & Viability

“Our idea is technically possible and can be implemented in phases – pilot, regional, and nationwide.
Challenges include cost, low digital literacy, and poor internet in rural areas.
We plan to overcome these with subsidies, farmer cooperatives, and training workshops.”

🎤 Slide 5 – Impact & Benefits

“This solution will:

Build trust and accountability in supply chains,

Give farmers fair prices and faster payments,

Reduce fraud and wastage,

Improve export quality and meet global standards.”

🎤 Slide 6 – Research & References

“We researched projects like IBM Food Trust and studied Ethereum smart contracts.
We also reviewed IEEE research papers and FAO reports on blockchain in agriculture.
The Government’s Agri-Stack initiative also inspired us.”

🎤 Closing

“To conclude, our solution ensures transparency, fair payments, and trust in agriculture supply chains using blockchain.
Thank you.”
