🌾 Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Transparency for Agricultural Produce
📘 Overview

This project aims to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain by integrating blockchain technology to ensure transparency, traceability, and fairness from farm to consumer. By leveraging decentralized systems, the platform empowers stakeholders—farmers, distributors, retailers, and consumers—to verify product origins, monitor quality, and ensure equitable pricing.

🎯 Objectives

Enhance Traceability: Allow consumers to trace the journey of agricultural products from farm to table.

Ensure Fair Pricing: Provide transparent pricing mechanisms to prevent exploitation.

Verify Quality and Origin: Enable stakeholders to authenticate the quality and origin of products.

Empower Stakeholders: Equip farmers and consumers with tools to verify transactions and reduce fraud.

🛠️ Technical Stack

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Blockchain: Ethereum (via Web3.js)

Database: MongoDB

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)


🧭 System Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

Application Layer: Handles user interactions and interfaces.

Blockchain Layer: Manages smart contracts for product tracking.

Infrastructure Layer: Ensures data storage and retrieval.

Each layer communicates seamlessly to provide a cohesive user experience.

🔄 Workflow

Product Listing: Farmers list their produce on the platform.

Smart Contract Deployment: A smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to track the product's journey.

Product Movement: As the product moves through the supply chain (from farmer to distributor to retailer), each transaction is recorded on the blockchain.

Consumer Verification: Consumers can scan QR codes on products to verify their authenticity and trace their journey.
